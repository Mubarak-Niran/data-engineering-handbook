# Architecture & Technologies in Data Engineering

## Data Engineering Architecture
- **Data Lakes vs. Data Warehouses**
  - Data Lakes: Store raw, structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
  - Data Warehouses: Optimized for analytics with structured data.

- **Modern Data Stack**
  - Ingestion: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub
  - Processing: Apache Spark, Flink, Dataflow
  - Storage: BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Delta Lake
  - Orchestration: Apache Airflow, Dagster, Prefect

## Data Modeling Approaches
- Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema
- Dimensional vs. Normalized Data Models
